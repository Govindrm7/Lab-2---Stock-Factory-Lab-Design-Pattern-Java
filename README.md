LAB: Add Singleton Factories to the Stock Program

Objective

The goal of this lab is to extend the Stock program by applying Design Patterns from the Gang of Four (GoF) — specifically the Factory Method and the Singleton patterns.

You will:
	1.	Create derived classes from Stock.
	2.	Build factories for each derived class using the Factory Method pattern.
	3.	Enhance those factories by also implementing Singleton variations:
	•	Lazy Singleton Factory
	•	Eager Singleton Factory
	4.	Demonstrate the usage of all factories in the demo() method.

Requirements
	•	Start with your existing Stock Assignment code as the base.
	•	Add TWO derived classes from Stock.
	•	For each derived class, create:
	•	One Factory (Factory Method only)
	•	One Singleton Factory (Factory Method + Singleton pattern)
	•	One must be Lazy Singleton.
	•	One must be Eager Singleton.
	•	Use these four factories to create stock objects in demo().
